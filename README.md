# sha1_hls
A fragment of code from sha1's hashing algorithm on high level synthesis.

Basically a hardware-accelerated function that sha1 uses for hashing using
Vivado HLS, applying directives and configurations to reduce latency, throughput
and minimize the use of resources.

Spanish version of the full report [here](http://bit.ly/2cuRnvf).

This investigation was a University project for the selective course 
"Algorithm hardware acceleration with Vivado HLS" from UNICEN, Tandil, Argentina.
